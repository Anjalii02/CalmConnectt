# CalmConnect

CalmConnect is a mental health sharing web app that provides users with a safe and anonymous platform to express their thoughts and feelings. Whether users feel unable to share their problems with close ones due to fear of judgment or simply need a supportive community, CalmConnect offers a space for them to post their concerns and receive consolation from others.

- **Personalized Chatbot:** A chatbot personalized for every user offers a listening ear and helps them navigate through difficult times.
- **Relaxing Games:** Users can take a break and relieve stress with a selection of relaxing games integrated into the app.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js for building a responsive and dynamic user interface.

- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data, posts, and comments securely.
